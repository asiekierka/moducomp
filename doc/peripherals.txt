Note, these documents are kinda crap and unofficial. But they should get you started somewhat.

Terminal (monitor + keyboard):
	$FDx03.b R - = #$01
	$FDx04.w - W = ? (echoing-related)
	$FDx08.b - W = print char
	$FDx0A.w - W = ?
	$FDx0C.w R - = get char from keyboard
	$FDx0E.b - W = ? (new line?)
	$FDx10.w - W = ? (colour-related)
	$FDx12.b - W = ?

	Interrupts:
	int0 = key received

Tape reader:
	$FDx03.b = #$02

	I really don't know how this works yet. Asie, please write this crap up. Thanks.
